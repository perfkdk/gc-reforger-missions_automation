  "There is a Command Truck next to HQ that can act as a Forward Spawn Point, where you can Teleport to it from the HQ Flag."\

  "Be mindful you can TP while its moving, and that it takes 5min to respawn should it be destroyed. Which means you'll either have to drive or utilize the Mi-8s"\

  "<b>\"Random Objectives\":</b>"\
  "A bit false as its not truly random (Cannot figure it out) but more objectives will be added and made to function at a random sequence"\
  ""\
  "<b>Respawns:</b>"\
  "There is about 1,000,000 respawn tickets, this may change where you gain tickets from completing objectives BUT for now you'll instantly respawn, along with vehicles at their cooldown."\
  ""\
  "<b>Hostile QRF:</b>"\
  "Should you get near the Antenna and the enemy spots you, they will call in QRF to reinforce the objective. This can be Infantry, APC, IFV or even Tanks. "\
  ""\
  "Destroying the Antenna will deny them the reinforcements."\
  ""\
  "<b>AI Inside Buildings:</b>"\
  "AI will be spawned inside buildings occupying them. NOT all buildings as we'd have far too many AI for the server to handle, but there will be AI in some if not most buildings depending on the location the objective spawns."\
  ""\
  "<b>Supply System:</b>"\
  "There is now a Supply System inplace where you can purchase new vehicles, equipment, ammo and more. Use it sparingly as the only way to get more supply is by completing Main Objectives, and also scavenge/steal any supplies might be located there back to our HQ"\
  ""\
  "<b>Rewards:</b>"\
  "Main Objectives now gives rewards for completing them, sometimes access to new vehicles and equipment, but will always provide an amount of supplies to the HQ's stockpile for us to utilize for future missions."\
  ""\
  "There is also supplies in the objective themselves that can be scavenged/stolen by loading up a truck or Mi-8 (or any vehicle capable of carrying supplies) and bring it back to Main HQ Supply Depot"\

  ""\
  "<b>Ambushes:</b>"\
  "Sometimes while driving down the road you may get ambushed by infantry or perhaps even vehicles, I know of a easy way to do this."\
  ""\
  "<b>More Objectives and perhaps a varied variety:</b>"\
  "I got ideas for a more variety of objectives than a simple \"Clear Town + Destroy Antenna\", which can be easily added to the pool."\
  ""\
  "<b>Side Objectives:</b>"\
  "A Side objective thats smaller but can potentially reward in newer vehicles like Tanks, Mi-24s, etc."\
  ""\
  "<b>Indirect Fire:</b>"\
  "Give AI indirect fire support, be it via triggers or a mortar team (if I can figure out AI mortar firing system)"\
  ""\
  "<b>COTVT Variant or even TVT Variant:</b>"\
  "Have either a very small 4-5 man strong defender team that can teleport to objectives to stay inside them to give more challange to the players"\
  "OR have two competing teams to clear objectives first, maybe giving the suceeding team with new better vehicles."\
