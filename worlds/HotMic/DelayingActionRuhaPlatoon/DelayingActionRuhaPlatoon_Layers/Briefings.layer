The momentum was encouraging; but unsustainable. Logistics were stretched, communication lines fragmented, and reserve elements lagged behind."\

  "In an uncharacteristic but calculated move, Soviet forces identified the vulnerability and began massing mechanized troops for a breakthrough assault."\
  ""\
  "Now, the U.S. 1st Platoon of Alpha Company has been ordered to hold the line long enough for the rest of the company to withdraw and regroup. They are to delay the Soviet assault by any means necessary."
