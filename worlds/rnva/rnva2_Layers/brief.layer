  m_sTextData "1990, Germany. War has broken out between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and Soviet Forces are advancing deeper and deeper into the northern plains of West Germany together with the NVA, aiming to reach the Rhine by day 7."\
  ""\
  "In this sector, the Panzer Regiment 22 \"Soja Kosmodemjanskaja\" of the East German 9. Panzer Division is leading the advance."\
  ""\
  "Due to the previously deteriorating political situation, the US had chosen to start deployment of most of its NORTHAG units shortly before the start of the war, as practiced during earlier Reforger exercises."\
  ""\
  "Among these forces is the 2nd Armored Division, soon expected to make first contact with the enemy. Until now, it had been screened by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, also part of the NORTHAG complement."

  "Our troops initial mission was to perform a passage of lines with the 2nd Armored Divisions previously screened 1st Brigade later today, which would blunt the regiments advance."\

  "However, a few hours ago, East German airmobile forces of the Luftsturmregiment 40 staged an air assault on Nyrhilanmaki (GRID), destroying most of Troop HQ and occupying the village."\
  ""\
  "While the enemy likely remains unaware of the friendly brigades proximity, this move prevented our cavalry troop from withdrawing north as originally planned, forcing an engagement with the enemy battalion."\

  "<b>b. Friendly Forces</b>"\

  "RED (scout platoon) and WHITE (tank platoon) are located in the vicinity of Hietalanmaki (GRID)."\
  "Black 8 (mortar) is set up in the forest at GRID, preparing to support the platoons using smoke rounds."\
  ""\
  "Unable to bypass the occupied village, BLUE and GREEN were forced to proceed north on their own, which means they are unable to support RED and WHITE."\
  ""\
  "A tank-heavy tank-mech company team from the 2nd Armored Divisions 1st Brigade is rushing south to break the encirclement and allow RED and WHITE to retreat, but is estimated to need at least another hour to arrive."
