  m_sTextData "1989, Germany. War has broken out between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and Soviet Forces are advancing deeper and deeper into the northern plains of West Germany together with the NVA, aiming to reach the Rhine by day 6."\
  ""\
  "In this sector, the Panzer Regiment 22 \"Soja Kosmodemjanskaja\" of the East German 9. Panzer Division is leading the advance."\
  ""\
  "Due to the previously deteriorating political situation, the US had chosen to start deployment of most of its NORTHAG units shortly before the start of the war, as practiced during earlier Reforger exercises."\
  ""\
  "Among these forces is the 2nd Armored Division, soon expected to make first contact with the enemy. Until now, it had been covered by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, also part of the NORTHAG complement."\
  ""\
  ""\
  "<b>A prior air assault by the East German LStR-40 on a cavalry troop headquarters deteriorated the troops command and control and left two of its platoons cut off, unable to avoid engagement with the advancing Panzer Regiment 22s 3rd battalion.</b>"

  m_sTextData "- 6 minute setup timer. Affects the NVA tanks, but NOT the NVA reconnaissance platoon."\
  "- If you are on the reconnaissance platoon and choose to make use of the lack of a setup timer, know that you may die very early. If you don't like that, either be extremely careful or wait for the tanks to join you."\
  ""\
  "- If you drive your vehicle into a ditch and can't get out, you may ask for GM help, but please try your best to just stay clear of them in the first place. There are many places where you can get past them without going right through."\
  "- If your vehicle gets destroyed but you survive, I recommend ascending to spectator by pressing the respawn button unless you find something to do."\
  "- If you are a Bradley gunner, you can switch to your TOW by holding V. You cannot select it using the number keys."\

  "The mission concludes when the NVA tank battalion has reached the area west of Ruha and Isomaki."\
  "A message will automatically be displayed some time after 60% of non-destroyed NVA tanks have entered this area."\
  "According to the situation, GMs may decide to keep the mission running beyond that or end it earlier."\
  "If the NVA tank battalion sustains severe casualties and is no longer effective, either the NVA commander or the GMs will call the mission. There is no automatic condition for this, as it highly depends on the situation."\
  "Before switching to the next mission, a GM will annouce the outcome."

  "Our troops initial mission was to perform a passage of lines with the 2nd Armored Divisions previously covered 1st Brigade later today, which would blunt the regiments advance."\
