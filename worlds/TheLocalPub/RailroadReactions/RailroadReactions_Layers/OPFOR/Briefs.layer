  "Enemy forces are the US Army."\
  "Partisans in this area have caused us to derail by sabotaging the railway. We had a brief fight with them after the derailment but they withdraw. It appear they are attempting to delay and fix us in place so the pursuing US force can catch up to us."\
  "We should expect contact to come from the North, which was direction we travelled."\
  ""\
  "|STRENGTHS, CAPABILITIES, LIMITATIONS|"\
  "• Much about the SCLs of the enemy are unknown."\
  "• We should expect a larger force with some kind of vehicles. Most likely light skinned/mobility to aid in quick maneuvers."\
  "• The biggest limitation the enemy will have is the ability to close distance with us unseen or with cover on one side of our train due to the large open swamp."\

  "We are the reamining 24x Russian troops of the train derailment. Part of the 275th Motor Rifle Regiment travelling by train on the retreat before our railway was sabotaged causing us to derail."\
  "We are located at GRID: 064059"\

  "Our nearest friendly unit is the 278th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, south of us 5km. They've dispatched a company to rescue us, ETA 30-40mins."\
  ""\
  "|STRENGTHS, CAPABILITIES, LIMITATIONS|"\
  "• Our train is armed and uparmoured."\
  "At either end of the train is a mounted ZU-23, throughout the train within the carriages or on top, we can find fighting positions that also have mounted machine guns."\
  "• While our movement in the area is uncontested, we should be mindful of our ability to do so quicker then a pursuing enemy."\
  "We have no vehicles and are soley on foot."\
  "Pushing to far with an inability to retreat fast could be costly."\
  "• The location in which the train derailed is decent terrain. "\
  "One whole side to our train is exposed by a large open swamp, giving us great sightlines and the enemy no concealmeant or cover to advance. We also have bridges at either end of the train, defendable woodblocks close by with funnels."\
  "There are also buildings within close proximity to the train which would be a good area to fight a delay from."\
  ""\
  "|SERVICE & SUPPORT|"\
  "• We were carrying supplies on the train. They've been strewn over the place thanks to the crash. Check the boxes near us and recover what we can. "\
  "There's various boxes containing different equipment such as an NSV 12.7mm HMG, launchers and ammo, AT & AP mines inlcuding demo charges, small arms ammo, throwables, and also fortifcation tool such as placeable barbed wire, sandbags, and also deployable foliage to conceal positions."

  "A Russian train with troops and equipment has been forced into retreat following the loss of control in the surrounding region. During its withdrawal, the train was ambushed by partisan resistance forces, who sabotaged the rail line and caused a derailment."\
  ""\
  "The ambush was not intended to destroy the force outright, but to delay and fix it in place. Resistance elements remain active in the area conducting harassment attacks and observing the stranded troops. The derailment has also drawn the attention of US forces, which are now advancing toward the site to exploit the situation and prevent an organized withdrawal."\
  ""\
  "Russian troops on the ground are isolated and operating with limited mobility. Reinforcements have been requested, but their arrival is uncertain. Until relief arrives, the derailed train and surrounding terrain must be held under increasing pressure."
