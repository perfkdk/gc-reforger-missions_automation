  "|LORE/BACKGROUND|"\
  "During the Soviet–Afghan War, the 220th Motor Rifle Company has been deployed to Taki Province as part of a routine unit rotation. The company’s task is to relieve a sister formation currently occupying a forward operating base and assume responsibility for the area for the next nine months."\
  "At the time of this operation, 220 Company is assembled at a designated staging location, conducting final preparations before movement. The unit is scheduled to advance as a motorized convoy along a planned route to its destination."\
  "The security situation in the region remains unstable. Mujahideen forces operate throughout the province in decentralized, irregular groups. Their strength, equipment, and intentions are well known, but reliable intelligence on recent activity along the route is limited."\
  "Although the convoy movement is assessed as routine, the environment remains unpredictable. Contact with hostile forces is possible during transit, and the unit must be prepared to react to ambush, harassment, or delays along the route."

  "Composition: Enemy forces are the deadly Mujahideen."\

  "Blending into the civilian population and also having garrisoned  cells typically in the mountains."\
  ""\
  "Disposition:"\
  "At the current time there is no known location of enemy fighters."\

  ""\
  "|STRENGTH & CAPABILITIES|"\
  "• A BMP was spotted operating within this area as reported by air assets passing overhead who observed it near Nagara."\
  "The Mujahideen have occasionally been known to use captured Soviet armoured vehicles such as BMPs, T-55s, BTRs, BRDMs, although in very limited numbers. "\
  "They appear to have good knowledge of each vehicles operations as if they've had prior training by someone."\
  "• The ability for the cell to call upon reinforcements quickly is likely."\
  "• The use of mines, IEDs, and UXOs are common practice by enemy forces, the current threat is high risk."\
  "- There is an old soviet AT minefield marked on our map east of Nur."\
  "• Known to use mortars, the current threat is low risk."\
  "• The Mujahideen have total freedom of movement within this region."\
  ""\
  "|LIMITATIONS & RESTRICTIONS|"\
  "• Unable to face us in direct combat. Our numbers and firepower would overwhelm them."\
  "• Old Soviet AT minefield near Nur."\
  ""\
  "MLCOA: Attempt to conduct a deliberate ambush while we're on route using explosive charges and/or mines to cause damage and disorientation, after striking quick with vehicles from established firing positons, before hastily withdrawing to conduct similar effects later."\
  ""\
  "MDCOA: Mujahideen forces manage to isolate us from mutual support and fixing friendly callsigns to a location so they can strike with that spotted BMP."
