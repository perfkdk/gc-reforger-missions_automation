  "Composition: Enemy forces are the Soviet Union, 220 Motor Rifle Company. These Soviet companies number roughly 75x pax, split across four platoons (2x Rifles, 1x support, 1x supply), and a COY HQ."\
  "Each Platoon minus the supply has 3x BTRs, although the supply platoon typically has some kind of light skinned armed vehicles for protection while in transit. "\
  "Reinforced from the regimental tank battalion by 1x T-72."\
  ""\
  "Disposition:"\
  "Our cell has been assigned to this new in country Motor Rifle Company who's arrived here for their tour over the next 9 months."\
  "They're on route currently through this region so they can link up with their sister company and relieve them. "\
  "Currently stopped at their rest stop, staging to step-off shortly from GRID 003056, proceeding North bound."\
  ""\
  "|STRENGTH & CAPABILITIES|"\
  "• 1x T-72, 3x BTRs, 1x ZU-23 Ural, 2x PKM UAZ."\
  "• Organic rearm, repair, and refuel within their company."\
  "• Company level medical team."\
  ""\
  "|LIMITATIONS & RESTRICTIONS|"\
  "• Limited in freedom of movement. Terrain restricts vehicle manvers and confines them to vallies often until later in the route near Nur."\
  "• No local supporting units so a QRF would take to long. Reinforcements are highly doubtful."\
  "• Old Soviet AT minefield near Nur."\
  ""\
  "MLCOA: The convoy will follow their planned route in close formation with tight security, stopping to engage any contact with overwhelming power to force us to retreat."\
  ""\
  "MDCOA: The convoy will deploy infantry screens ahead and around the convoy - more so on the hilltops, to guard forward and either force an early engagement or to force us to withdraw from positions by disrupting us, thus potentially revealing us to fire."\
  "This would allow the vehicles to move far less contested to areas which can be strongpointed and used to re-org and continue from."\

  "|LORE/BACKGROUND|"\
  "During the Soviet–Afghan War, the 220th Motor Rifle Company has been deployed to Taki Province as part of a routine unit rotation. The company’s task is to relieve a sister formation currently occupying a forward operating base and assume responsibility for the area for the next nine months."\
  "At the time of this operation, 220 Company is assembled at a designated staging location, conducting final preparations before movement. The unit is scheduled to advance as a motorized convoy along a planned route to its destination."\
  "The security situation in the region remains unstable. Mujahideen forces operate throughout the province in decentralized, irregular groups. Their strength, equipment, and intentions are well known, but reliable intelligence on recent activity along the route is limited."\
  "Although the convoy movement is assessed as routine, the environment remains unpredictable. Contact with hostile forces is possible during transit, and the unit must be prepared to react to ambush, harassment, or delays along the route."
