  "|PERFORMANCE|"\
  "The performance on this rig compared to Arma 3 is much higher, yet you may fine that during the night, lighting will cause a lower FPS due to lamps/lights having to cast mutiple smaller shadows around and through props. This is also worse if it's also raining heavy."\
  "This is most noticeable in the center where the big flood lights cast the shadows from the big tower, gangwalks, and chain lined fences."\
  "Try turning your shadows or lighting quality down to increase FPS."\
  "(In my testing at full graphics, I had 45+ FPS in the center at night)"\
  "- If it's unplayable, a GM can change the weather and/or time to be something similar but not as bad, have some discretion."
