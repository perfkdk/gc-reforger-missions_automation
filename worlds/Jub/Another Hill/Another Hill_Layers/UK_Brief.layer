 "We are in the company hide, grid 073098, facing southwest. To our front is Coronation Ridge, 55m elevation. To our right is Brenton Loch and to our left is Darwin Road, which runs from northeast to southwest through Coronation Ridge and eventually curves left to Darwin. Our right boundary is the water and our left boundary with A Coy is marked approximately 100-200 meters left of and parallel with Darwin Road."\

 "Beyond Coronation Ridge is an 800m long expanse of uneven treeless grassland with some rocky outcropping. There are two peat bogs, Boy Bog and Girl Bog, that are shallow and can be crossed. There is foliage and microterrain that will provide some cover and concealment but overall sightlines are generally clear."\

 "On the other side of the expanse is Middle Hill, grid 066086, 35m elevation, which is our company objective. There is a small stream, Baby Stream, that runs from the east side of Middle Hill southeast through Darwin Road. Beyond Middle Hill is Boca Stream, which runs northwest to southeast from Brenton Loch to Darwin."\
